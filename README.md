# Parking-Sensors

This is a Visual Studio C# and Arduino project that consists in a bar with 5 ultrasonic sensors model HC-SR04 connected at equal distance to each other. Those sensors are connected to an Arduino Uno development board, with which we will send the received data through serial communication to a laptop application that will display the values returned by sensors together with a graphical user interface that is easier to be noticed during parking.


The project was realised in team with Ionut Florea.
